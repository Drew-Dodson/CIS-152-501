    <h2>My Favorite Beverage</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite beverage is typically water for the bulk of my day. Somestimes
      I do drink coffee or tea in the mornings but have been trying to cut down
      on my caffeine intake. My adult beverage of choice is usually craft beers
      from local San Diego breweries.
